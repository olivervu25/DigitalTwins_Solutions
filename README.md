This repository contains solutions to the test problems for the RSQLiteAdmin visualisation tools project for GSoC 2023.

## Easy Test

### Description

Download the leaflet package and demonstrate it with a naturally occurring time series. Document it with RMarkdown.

### Solution

For the easy task, I utilized the `Leaflet` package to create interactive maps for two datasets. Firstly, I visualized earthquake data using Leaflet with the `quakes` dataset. Secondly, I created a mock property company dataset and visualized their properties on the map using `Leaflet`. Additionally, I integrated the Leaflet maps with `Shiny` to enhance interactivity and functionality.

## Medium Test

### Description

Real-time data integration is my suggestion as a valuable addition to the Leaflet package in future versions. This feature would allow developers to incorporate live data feeds directly into their Leaflet maps, updating the visualizations in real-time as new data becomes available.

## Hard Test 

### Description

Develop a dummy code of 5 functions and a vignette and pass it with no Error/Warning/Note through https://win-builder.r-project.org/

### Solution 

The hard test involved creating a package called "squarepolynomials" with 5 functions for working with the square of polynomials, including root finding, min/max identification, visualization, and value finding. A vignette was developed to demonstrate the usage of the package, and the package was successfully tested with no errors, warnings, or notes on https://win-builder.r-project.org/. This demonstrates ,y strong proficiency in R programming, data manipulation, and package development.
